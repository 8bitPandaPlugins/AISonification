## AI Sonification

This project will consist of a Frogger style game in which an AI has to complete. Each generation of AI having an effect on sound/music that is also created due to how many times the AI dies in game. 

### How will it work?

The main game will run and the user will be able to see the AI trying to complete it, dying and respawning for each generation until it finally works out how to complete it.

As for the music side of the application that will work by using sliders or dials to adjust what style of music they want played. The exact choices haven’t been completely decided but something along the lines of a slider/dial that will control the “Roughness” and another for the “Pitch” etc.
